the code shape detector gimbal uses a webcam to detect blue shapes it can detect triangle circle square and pentagon. this uses a mask that is currently set
so you can make shapes out of blue masking tape and have the robot detect them. The charger detector code uses this and this distance function 
from an intel stereo depth camera to dirtect the robot.
